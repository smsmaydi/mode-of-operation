# UML Diagrams

This file summarizes the available diagrams for the project. The diagrams are conceptual and describe the data flow and node interactions.

## Available Diagram Types
- State machine: mode switching (ECB/CBC/CTR)
- Sequence: input  compute  output flow
- Activity: computeGraphValues lifecycle
- Component: node types and utilities

## How to Use
1. Start with the state machine diagram for mode behavior.
2. Review the sequence diagram to understand data propagation.
3. Use the activity diagram to trace computeGraphValues.
